# **Towards a Customizable Text-to-speech Personal Assistant**

14/11/2023 Discussion: The Progress Checkpoint

---

# Contents
- Main Idea
- Progress: Chinese Support
- What to do next?
    - Support for another language.
    - A website for project introduction.
    - Write report.
    - Presentation.

# Main Idea

- Use the VITS model as the backbone.
    - Paper: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06103>
    - Github repo: <https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vits>
- Our contributions:
    1. New language support: train the VITS model on Chinese datasets from scratch.
    2. New speakers: fine-tune the VITS model on two languages with pre-trained models.

# Chinese Support
- Dataset: Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Copus（10000 Sentences）[[download link]](https://www.data-baker.com/data/index/TNtts/) [[introduction]](https://www.data-baker.com/open_source.html)
- Hardware: 1 Titan Xp GPU.
- Train the model for 96,000 steps. (~ 48 hours)
- DEMO: 
"我爱计算机科学！"

---

# Fine-tuning: Chinese
- Use a pretrained model.
- Dataset: AISHELL-3 [[download link](https://www.openslr.org/93/)][[introduction](https://www.aishelltech.com/aishell_3)].
- Fine-tuning the model for 84,500 steps in total. (~ 16 hours)
- Add five speakers: child voice, young female voice, middle-aged female voice, young male voice, middle-aged male voice.
- DEMO

# Support for Another Language
- **Plan A**: English
- **Plan B**: Japanese
- **Assignee: Siwen Tu**
- **DDL: 30/11/2023**
- Dataset: JVS (Japanese versatile speech) corpus [[link]](https://sites.google.com/site/shinnosuketakamichi/research-topics/jvs_corpus)
- Add six speakers: child voice, young female voice, young male voice, adult female voice, adult male voice, aged male voice.

# Supplements
Download model weights and configuration files from [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yrEgbSiH2O34LlALvl7asaYes1Y3IBL7?usp=drive_link):
- Training from scratch, Chinese.
- Fine-tuning, Chinese.
- Fine-tuning, Japanese.

# A Website for Project Introduction
- A static website is good enough.
    - Just for reference: [VITS demo](https://jaywalnut310.github.io/vits-demo/index.html), [2022 project](https://api-final-project.vercel.app/)
- Plans
    - **Plan A**: Use GitHub to build a website.
    - **Plan B**: Deploy the website on a server.
    - Other.
- **Assignee: Chenyu Shi**
- **DDL: 30/11/2023**
